# WebGL Maze Game â€“ Football Through the Maze

## Game Abstract
A 3D WebGL maze game where players guide a football through a maze using physics. The objective is to reach the exit by controlling the ball's movement. The game uses Three.js for graphics and Box2DWeb for physics simulations.

## Project Information
- **Domain**: WebGL Application (Interactive Web-Based Game)

## Tools Used
- **Box2DWeb**: A physics engine for simulating movement and collisions of the ball within the maze.
- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library used to render the 3D maze and football.

## Game Instructions
- Use the arrow keys or WASD to control the movement of the football.
- Navigate the football through the maze to find the exit.
- Avoid obstacles and manage physics-based interactions to successfully reach the exit.
